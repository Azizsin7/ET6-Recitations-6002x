# 🍷 Drunk Walk Simulation Activity – Breakout Room Challenge

Welcome to our interactive class activity on **Random Walk Simulation**.  
This challenge is **adapted from a midterm question used in a previous year**, giving you the chance to solve a real problem under collaborative and competitive conditions.

You will work in teams to analyze the behavior of different types of "drunks" and identify their movement patterns based on the plots generated.

---

## 🎓 Background

In lecture, we explored the concept of a random walk using models of different drunks. Below is the code for `Location`, `Field`, and `Drunk` classes used in simulation. You **do not need to study the code in detail**, but it is included for your reference.

### 📦 Code from Lecture

```python
import pylab

class Location(object):
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    def move(self, deltaX, deltaY):
        return Location(self.x + deltaX, self.y + deltaY)

    def getX(self):
        return self.x

    def getY(self):
        return self.y

    def distFrom(self, other):
        ox = other.x
        oy = other.y
        xDist = self.x - ox
        yDist = self.y - oy
        return (xDist**2 + yDist**2)**0.5

    def __str__(self):
        return '<' + str(self.x) + ', ' + str(self.y) + '>'
```

```python
class Field(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self.drunks = {}

    def addDrunk(self, drunk, loc):
        if drunk in self.drunks:
            raise ValueError('Duplicate drunk')
        else:
            self.drunks[drunk] = loc

    def moveDrunk(self, drunk):
        if drunk not in self.drunks:
            raise ValueError('Drunk not in field')
        xDist, yDist = drunk.takeStep()
        currentLocation = self.drunks[drunk]
        self.drunks[drunk] = currentLocation.move(xDist, yDist)

    def getLoc(self, drunk):
        if drunk not in self.drunks:
            raise ValueError('Drunk not in field')
        return self.drunks[drunk]
```
### 🔧 New Code for Tracking Walk Vector
```python
import random
import math

class Drunk(object):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
    def __str__(self):
        return 'This drunk is named ' + self.name
```
### 🤪 Drunk Variations
```python
class UsualDrunk(Drunk):
    def takeStep(self):
        return random.choice([(0.0,1.0), (0.0,-1.0), (1.0, 0.0), (-1.0, 0.0)])

class ColdDrunk(Drunk):
    def takeStep(self):
        return random.choice([(0.0,0.9), (0.0,-1.03), (1.03, 0.0), (-1.03, 0.0)])

class EDrunk(Drunk):
    def takeStep(self):
        ang = 2 * math.pi * random.random()
        length = 0.5 + 0.5 * random.random()
        return (length * math.sin(ang), length * math.cos(ang))

class PhotoDrunk(Drunk):
    def takeStep(self):
        return random.choice([(0.0, 0.5), (0.0, -0.5), (1.5, 0.0), (-1.5, 0.0)])

class DDrunk(Drunk):
    def takeStep(self):
        return random.choice([(0.85, 0.85), (-0.85, -0.85),
                              (-0.56, 0.56), (0.56, -0.56)])
```
## 🧠 Problem Description

Each plot you will examine was generated by simulating a random walk with one of the five drunk types:

- `UsualDrunk`
- `ColdDrunk`
- `EDrunk`
- `PhotoDrunk`
- `DDrunk`

Each drunk took **1000 steps**, and the simulation was repeated across **1000 trials**.

Your task is to:

- Review each plot.
- Discuss with your group.
- Decide **which drunk** most likely generated each plot.
- **Do NOT guess randomly** — base your judgment on the movement characteristics shown in lecture.

## 🧪 Breakout Room Instructions

You will be split into **2 groups**:

- **Group 1** → with **Reymond**
- **Group 2** → with **Ian**

Each group will receive the same 5 plots.

Use the full 30 minutes to discuss, debate, and come to a consensus.


---

### 👥 Group Goal

- Identify all 5 correctly before the other group.
- Explain your reasoning during the main room discussion.

---

## 🧩 Plots to Match (To Be Shown Live)

- Plot 1 → ???
- Plot 2 → ???
- Plot 3 → ???
- Plot 4 → ???
- Plot 5 → ???

---

## 🏁 Main Room Final Round

After 30 minutes, both groups return to the main room. You will:

- Present your decisions  
- Defend your reasoning  
- See the correct answers revealed  
- Celebrate the group with the highest correct count 🎉

---

## ✅ Reminder

Focus on understanding the logic and behavior behind each drunk type.  
This is **not about luck** — it's about applying what you learned and working together.

**Good luck, and have fun!**
