## üí¨ Sample Answers to Discussion Questions

---

### 1. Which confidence interval is wider? Why?

‚úÖ The confidence interval for the **high-variance sample** is wider.

**Reason:**  
The standard deviation (SD) is higher in the high-variance population.  
Since CI is calculated as:

CI = mean ¬± 1.96 √ó (SD / ‚àön)


A larger SD increases the **margin of error**, resulting in a **wider interval**.

---

### 2. What does this tell you about the relationship between variation and confidence?

‚úÖ **More variation = less confidence** in your estimate from a small sample.

- High variation means your sample mean is less reliable.
- Confidence intervals widen to reflect this uncertainty.
- In contrast, low variation gives tighter, more trustworthy estimates.

---

### 3. How does the variation in the population affect the stability of the sample mean?

‚úÖ High variation leads to **unstable sample means** across repeated samples.

- In high-SD populations, sample means jump around more.
- In low-SD populations, samples give more consistent estimates.
- This is why **low-CV data is more predictable**.

---

### 4. What would happen if we increased the sample size?

‚úÖ Confidence intervals would become **narrower** for both distributions.

**Why?**

- The margin of error in the CI formula shrinks as `n` increases:
  
  Margin of error ‚àù 1 / ‚àön

- Larger samples reduce randomness and improve estimate accuracy.
- Even high-variance data becomes **more manageable** with more data.
