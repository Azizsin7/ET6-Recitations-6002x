 🧠 **"Simulation models are descriptive, not prescriptive."**

🔍 Descriptive vs. Prescriptive

✅ Descriptive models:
- Describe what is happening or what could happen.
- Help you understand a system by simulating outcomes based on input parameters.
- They do not tell you what to do; instead, they show possible consequences of different scenarios.

✅ Prescriptive models:
- Go a step further — they tell you what actions to take to optimize or solve a problem.
- They are solution-focused and often include optimization algorithms or decision rules.

🧪 So what does the quote mean?
When we say:

"Simulation models are descriptive, not prescriptive."

We mean that:
- A simulation is used to observe how a system behaves under certain conditions.
- It helps you analyze scenarios, test assumptions, or see potential outcomes — like running a simulation of how a disease spreads or how a factory operates.
- But the simulation does not recommend a specific decision or solution.

📌 Example:
Suppose you're managing inventory in a warehouse.
- A simulation model might show you what happens to stock levels under different customer demand patterns.
- Maybe it shows that running out of stock is more likely during holidays.
- This is descriptive: it's giving you insight.

But it won't tell you:
- How much to order
- When to reorder
- How to minimize cost

That would require a prescriptive model, like an optimization algorithm that suggests actions to take.

✅ In short:
- Simulation = “What if?” tool
- Prescriptive = “What should I do?” tool
