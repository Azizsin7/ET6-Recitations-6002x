# Scenario:
# You have three dice:
# - Die A: values from 1 to 6
# - Die B: values from 2 to 5
# - Die C: values from 1 to 8
# In each round, all three dice are rolled.
# The die with the highest number wins.
# If there's a tie, it's counted as a "Tie".
# We simulate 1000 rounds and visualize the results.
