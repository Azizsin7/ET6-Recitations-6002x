# ðŸª£ Probability Simulation â€“ Drawing Balls with Replacement

## ðŸŽ¯ Scenario: Understanding Probabilities Through Repeated Random Draws

You are given a bucket containing an equal number of red and green balls:

- ðŸŽˆ 3 **Red (R)** balls
- ðŸŽˆ 3 **Green (G)** balls

You draw **3 balls in succession**, **with replacement** â€” meaning the ball is placed back into the bucket after each draw, so probabilities remain constant.

The goal of this simulation is to estimate the **empirical probability** of specific outcomes by repeating the experiment **1,000 times**.

## ðŸ§ª What Are We Tracking?

In each set of 3 draws, the code keeps track of the number of times we observe:

- ðŸŽ¯ `RRR`: All three balls drawn are red
- ðŸŽ¯ `RGR`: The exact sequence Red â†’ Green â†’ Red
- ðŸŽ¯ `2R1G`: Any combination that includes exactly two red and one green ball
- ðŸŽ¯ `R â‰¥ G`: Any draw in which the number of red balls is **greater than or equal to** the number of green balls

## ðŸ›  How It Works

- A list `['R', 'G', 'R', 'G', 'R', 'G']` simulates the bucket.
- On each trial, the simulation:
  1. Randomly selects 3 balls with replacement
  2. Checks if the result matches any of the tracked conditions
  3. Updates the corresponding counter
- After 1,000 trials, the results are plotted using:
  - ðŸ“Š A **bar chart** to show frequency of each outcome
  - ðŸ¥§ A **pie chart** to visualize outcome proportions (optional)
