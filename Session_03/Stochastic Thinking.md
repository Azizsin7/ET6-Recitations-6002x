# üìò Introduction to Stochastic Thinking & Processes

Stochastic Thinking is a core concept in data science, computational modeling, and many real-world systems.
It involves reasoning under uncertainty, using randomness to simulate or analyze systems whose exact outcomes cannot be precisely predicted.

üîç What is a Stochastic Process?
- A stochastic process is a system or model that evolves over time **with inherent randomness**.
- Unlike deterministic systems, where the same inputs always produce the same outputs, stochastic systems can yield different outcomes even when starting conditions are the same.

üåç Real-World Relevance:
Stochastic processes are used to model:
- Weather and climate systems
- Stock market behavior
- Disease spread and health outcomes
- Traffic patterns
- Natural population dynamics

# üß™ Case Study Activity: Population Growth Simulation

We'll model population growth over generations. The reproduction behavior of individuals is influenced by **randomness** ‚Äî not every individual will reproduce. This introduces **stochasticity** into how the population changes over time.

üìå Scenario:
Imagine you are studying a population of wild animals reintroduced into a protected nature reserve.
You begin with an initial population of 5 animals. Each generation (e.g., a year), every animal has an 80% chance of successfully reproducing ‚Äî depending on food availability, predation, disease, and other unpredictable natural events.

You want to understand:
- Whether the population is likely to grow or decline under these conditions
- How much the population size can vary due to chance
- The potential long-term trends over several generations

This simulation reflects the randomness of natural reproduction and helps conservationists assess the viability of wildlife populations in unpredictable ecosystems.

## Key Simulation Components:
1. **Initial Population**: Starting number of individuals.
2. **Reproduction Probability**: Likelihood an individual will reproduce in each generation.
3. **Stochastic Process**: Use of `random.uniform()` to model probabilistic reproduction.
4. **Generation-to-Generation Evolution**: Observe how population size changes over multiple generations.
