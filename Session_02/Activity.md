## üéØ Class Activity: Visualizing BFS vs DFS

### üîç Objective
Understand how Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) explore a graph differently.

### üß∞ Tool
We‚Äôll use this interactive website:
üëâ [Algorithm Visualizer - DFS/BFS](https://algorithm-visualizer.org/brute-force/depth-first-search)

> No coding is required for this activity!

### üóÇÔ∏è Instructions

#### Step 1: Warm-Up Discussion (5 mins)
Briefly review:
- What BFS and DFS are
- When to use them
- Their differences in strategy

#### Step 2: Group Exploration (20 mins)
- You‚Äôll be divided into pairs or breakout rooms.
- Use the **Algorithm Visualizer** to simulate a BFS and DFS search.
- Choose two nodes in the graph and observe the search pattern.
- Discuss:
  - Which nodes were visited?
  - In what order?
  - Which algorithm found the shortest path (if any)?

üìå **Things to pay attention to:**
- DFS may go deep but miss the shortest route.
- BFS checks neighbors level-by-level and usually finds the shortest unweighted path.

---

#### Step 3: Share & Discuss (5 mins)
- Each group shares what they found:
  - Did BFS and DFS return different results?
  - Which was faster in your example?
  - Where might each be useful?

---

### ‚úÖ Optional Challenge (Homework)
- Implement BFS or DFS on a small graph in Python.
- Use print statements to track the node visit order.
- Reflect: How did your implementation compare with the visualizer?

üß† Remember: Visualization helps build **intuition**, and intuition helps with **coding and interviews**!
